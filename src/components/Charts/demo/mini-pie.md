title: Mini pie chart
---

Through simplification of `Pie` property settings, you can quickly implement a minimalist pie chart that can be combined with `ChartCard`.
Now you can implement for more business scenarios.

```jsx
import { Pie } from 'ant-design-pro/lib/Charts';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Pie percent={28} subTitle="Chinese fast food" total="28%" height={140} />,
  mountNode
);
```
